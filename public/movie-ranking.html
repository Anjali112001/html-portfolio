<h1>The Best Movies According to Anjali</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all the time!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p>This movie taught me to follow your dreams no matter what but come back from where you belong once in a while.</p>
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>This movie taught me to live freely and seize the day not the whole future. Always live in the present because you
    don't know what your tomorrow will bring to you.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This movie taught me that don't ever follow success always follow excellence and success will come to you
    automatically.</p>
